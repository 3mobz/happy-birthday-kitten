		<di<p style="font-size:10px;">Happy 19th birthday, Priyanka 💝 This is the exact moment you turned 19. It's 12:00 am, 16th of June, 2024. I don't know when you are reading this message, but it was sent exactly at 12:00. Happy birthday again! 🍼, wait don't exit messages will be visible.. 
			    I waited 8 days, you can wait few seconds for me😅</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">And not only it's your birthday, but also it's a day to look back at all your memories that you had for 19 years of this life. You're 19 years old now, which is about 166554 hours, and it may vary depending on the time of your birth, which I do not know because you didn't show me your birth certificate 😡.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">In minutes if you count, it's 9993240 minutes, and by the time you're reading this message, it's 9993242 and counting. In seconds it will be, 599594400, and it changed, again changed, and yes, again changed, haha.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">Anyways, if you look back in time you might not remember how you were born in the hospital, hehe. You might not remember those nurses who held you in hands, you might not remember the smile on the face of your dad and mom. They are the persons in this whole world who love you the most, did you understand me 😡, doesn't matter if your boyfriend says he loves you the most, he's still on the 3rd rank 😡.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">I'm kidding, I love you the most!! But do you remember those things when you were born? 
	Socho socho😁😁🤔🤔</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">I know you're thinking that, "how will I remember I was just a baby!" Well, you can imagine it, it's like virtual reality, but in your head. And yes, you thought it right, "you were just a baby" and still just a baby🍼.</p>

 

<p style="font-size:9px;">Priyanka, on this special day, although it's night. Okay then. On this special night, or maybe day! Idk.. anyways, I want you to think of the names of 3 persons whom you love the most. In 10 seconds. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 You thought of them? Okay good now wait, listen to this story.</p>
<p style="font-size:9px;">So, there lived a king long time ago in Germany, his name was Nitzchergchery Géfrztexilnson 🇩🇪, and he was a good poet, he used to write stories, and poems. But wait a minute 🧐, did you just ignore his name, okay! Because you ignored his name, I'll not tell you the whole story 🤪.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">Okay now, what I was about to say was, those three names whom you love the most. I don't care who they are because you again forgot to choose yourself in those 3 people 🥺. Why!!!🥺🥺 Love yourself, embrace yourself, Priyanka. You are beautiful, kind, generous, and a berry good girl.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">I never write paragraphs... I'm writing it this much long because it's your birthday 😡🍼. I can write long long long paragraphs for you, but that will make things different.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">Idk how long this message will be, but it will be interesting I guess. I may not exist next year to wish you again in the same way, or maybe a more unexpected and cooler and –98°C cool way. I have an idea. I'll not tell it to you but if I'm alive till next year, you'll see it by yourself.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">And yes, happy birthday again and again and again 🍼. I'm happy for you. You turned 19, you happy me also happy Your heart has beaten 665,000,000 💓 times in 19 years, and by the time you're reading this message, it has increased by a couple more hundred times📈. In those 19 years, your heart has felt different feelings, sorrow, grief, joy, regret, happiness but still working fine. It healed by itself. It still works. I love it, how it works 24*7 non stop.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">I don't know how to give compliments, I just say good, and you are good. And  I love you, sometimes I don't. It's okay, it's just my inner self, he's a bad person, but trust me, I love you.</p>

<p style="font-size:9px;">Im sorry if I said anything unwanted haha. You know I'm not a mind reader but, I can assure you that you are reading this message in your mind but, in my voice👀.  I built and designed this website from 1 week, just for you🌷</p>

 

<p style="font-size:16px;">I dreamt of something which I hope will happen.  Happy birthday, Bye.💖</p>
			<p style="font-size:14px;">I LOVE YOU ❤️</p>
